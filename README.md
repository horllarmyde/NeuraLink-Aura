## 🌟 What It Does
NeuroLink Aura is a **telepathic communication device** that lets users share emotions and thoughts silently. Using a lightweight wearable headset and a connected mobile app, it interprets subtle brain signals (EEG) and translates them into visual or sensory cues, allowing people to understand each other without speaking a word.

## 💡 Why It Matters
In today’s world, communication often loses tone and emotion. Misunderstandings are common, and people who are shy, introverted, deaf, or speech-impaired struggle to express themselves.  
NeuroLink Aura restores emotional clarity, empathy, and inclusion, enabling genuine connection beyond words.
